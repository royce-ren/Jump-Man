**Game Title:** Jump Man

## Game Proposal ##

I want to make a game based off of one very popular game that is on Steam, Jump King, although with some edits. Here's the URL to a speedrun of the original game for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktVhJ41AExU. It's essentially a 2-D platformer that moves up through stages, kind of like Getting Over It. The player controls a character who navigates through obstacles that I'll add such as fire, ice, spikes, etc... each with special effects. They will jump from platform to platform, trying to reach the top of the level, and if they fall, then they are not going to have a fun time. This will require jump physics, and I may add power-ups and enemies (that you could potentially shoot?) once I get the basics of the game done.

Game Controls:

+ Arrow Keys control which direction the play faces/moves
+ Space Bar being held changes how much power player jumps
+ Mouse Button to shooter/control jump angle? <-- potentially

Game Elements:

+ Jump physics
    + Gravity, angle, jumping at different speeds\
+ Obstacles to avoid
    + Fire: instant death, back to start of the current level
    + Spikes: same as fire, just looks different
    + Ice: slippery
    + Mud?: slows down, less jump height
+ Platforms to jump off of
    + Can be slanted to slide the player off, level, disappear, etc...
+ Power ups that can change jump heights, speeds, etc...
+ Enemies that can block the way
+ Level system
    + Not explicitly shown, but different scenes to make it seem like the player is moving upwards as they progress
    + Somehow transfer position data from previous scene to new one

How to Win:

+ Reach the end of the game at the very top!

Doodle Jump is a similar example, but I don't plan on using continuous scrolling.
